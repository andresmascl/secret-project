## What is Scrap AI Bot?

Scrap AI Bot adds voice control to [Anthropic's Computer Use Demo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo), enabling hands-free computer automation through natural language.

**Say "Ok Computer"** → Speak your command → Watch AI execute it

### Example Commands

- "Ok Computer, open Firefox and search for Python tutorials"
- "Ok Computer, create a new text document with today's date"
- "Ok Computer, take a screenshot and save it to desktop"
- "Ok Computer, organize my downloads folder by file type"

## How It Works

```
[Wake Word: "Ok Computer"]
    ↓
[Audio Capture]
    ↓
[Speech-to-Text (Whisper)]
    ↓
[Claude Computer Use API]
    ├── Takes screenshots
    ├── Reasons about actions
    ├── Controls mouse/keyboard
    └── Executes multi-step tasks
    ↓
[Task Complete]
```

## Features

- 🎤 **Wake word activation** - "Ok Computer" triggers listening
- 🗣️ **Natural language** - Speak commands like you would to a person
- 👁️ **Visual understanding** - Claude sees your screen and reasons about it
- 🖱️ **Full computer control** - Mouse, keyboard, and bash commands
- 🔄 **Multi-step execution** - Handles complex tasks automatically
- 🐳 **Dockerized** - Runs in safe, isolated environment
- 🔒 **Privacy-focused** - Only audio after wake word is processed

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ (64-bit)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Microphone
- Display
- API Keys:
  - [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (Claude)
  - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/) (Whisper)
  - [Picovoice Access Key](https://console.picovoice.ai/) (Wake word)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:andresmascl/scrapbot.ai.git
cd scrap-ai-bot

# Run the installation script (handles everything)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/install.sh

# Configure API keys
nano .env  # Add your API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY)
```

### First Run

```bash
# Start the service
./scripts/start.sh

# Access the interface
# VNC viewer: localhost:5900
# Web interface: http://localhost:6080

# Stop the service
./scripts/stop.sh
```

Say **"Ok Computer"** followed by your command. The system will:
1. Capture your voice
2. Transcribe to text
3. Send to Claude with screenshot
4. Execute actions visually
5. Return to listening

## Configuration

Edit `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
wake_word:
  keyword: "ok computer"
  sensitivity: 0.5

audio:
  sample_rate: 16000
  record_seconds: 5
  silence_threshold: 500

api:
  anthropic_model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  whisper_model: "whisper-1"

computer_use:
  display_width: 1024
  display_height: 768
  max_steps: 50
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Lint code
flake8 voice-layer/
black voice-layer/
```

### Architecture Overview

Scrap AI Bot is built on three layers:

1. **Voice Layer** (this project) - Wake word, audio capture, transcription
2. **AI Layer** (Anthropic's Computer Use) - Vision, reasoning, tool execution
3. **System Layer** (Docker + X11) - Safe execution environment

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

### For AI Assistants

If you're an AI coding assistant working on this project, please read [AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for specific guidance on how components interact and coding standards.

## Roadmap

### Current Status: Alpha

- [x] Basic voice control integration
- [x] Wake word detection
- [x] Computer Use API integration
- [ ] Stable multi-step execution
- [ ] Error recovery
- [ ] Audio feedback (TTS)

### Planned Features

- [ ] Custom wake word training
- [ ] Task templates and macros
- [ ] Voice feedback with TTS
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Mobile device control
- [ ] Plugin system

### Commercial Features (Future)

- Premium recommendation engine
- Team collaboration features
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Managed hosting service
- Priority support

## Security & Privacy

- **Local wake word detection** - No audio sent to cloud until activated
- **Sandboxed execution** - Runs in isolated Docker container
- **API key security** - Keys stored in environment variables only
- **Audit logging** - All actions logged for review

⚠️ **Warning**: This gives AI control over your computer. Review all actions and use in controlled environments only.

## Known Limitations

- Requires display (headless mode not yet supported)
- English language only (currently)
- High API costs for extended use
- Occasional misinterpretation of visual elements
- Requires stable internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### Wake word not detecting

```bash
# Test microphone
arecord -l

# Adjust sensitivity in config/settings.yaml
wake_word:
  sensitivity: 0.7  # Increase for better detection
```

### Computer Use actions failing

```bash
# Check Docker container logs
docker logs scrap-ai-bot

# Verify API keys
./scripts/test_voice.sh
```

### Audio quality issues

```bash
# Test audio capture
python -m voice-layer.audio_capture --test

# Check sample rate matches your microphone
pactl list sources
```
