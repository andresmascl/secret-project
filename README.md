# Hey Computer

**Hey Computer** is a local-first, Linux-based voice assistant focused on **continuous listening**, **wake word detection**, **speech understanding**, and **voice feedback**, designed to run entirely on an old laptop or low-resource machine.

The project is intentionally minimal and modular, with a strong emphasis on **real-time audio processing**, **AI-driven intent recognition**, and **developer ownership**.

---

## What Hey Computer Does

- Continuously listens to microphone input
- Detects a custom wake word ("Alezo") using semantic embeddings
- Records speech and waits for silence
- Converts speech to text (STT)
- Infers user intent from a predefined intent list
- Produces structured JSON responses
- Replies to the user using local neural text-to-speech (TTS)

All core logic is designed to be **local-first** and runnable on commodity hardware.

## What Hey Computer Does NOT Do (yet)

- ❌ Browser automation
- ❌ Smart-home integrations
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ No always-on cloud dependency
- ❌ Consumer assistant UI

Hey Computer is a **voice processing and intent inference engine**, not a full Alexa replacement (yet).

## Voice Processing Pipeline

```
→ Continuous listening (local)
→ Wake word detection (semantic embeddings) (local)
→ Silence detection (local)
→ Speech-to-Text (STT) (cloud)
→ Intent recognition (cloud)
→ JSON response
→ Text-to-Speech (TTS) (local)
```

## Tech Stack (LinkedIn-Friendly)

### Audio & Runtime
- **Python 3.10+**
- **AsyncIO**
- **PyAudio** (real-time microphone streaming)
- **WebRTC VAD** (silence detection)

### AI / NLP
- **Sentence Transformers** — wake word & semantic intent matching
- **Google Speech-to-Text** — speech recognition
- **Google Dialogflow** — intent classification and NLP

### Voice Output
- **Coqui TTS** — local neural text-to-speech (CPU-based)

### System
- **Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)**
- **Local-first, event-driven architecture**

## Example Flow

1. System continuously listens to audio input
2. User says:
   
   **"Alezo, what time is it"**

3. Wake word is detected via embeddings
4. Speech is recorded until silence is detected
5. Audio is transcribed to text
6. Intent is inferred and returned as structured JSON
7. A spoken response is generated via TTS

---

## Hardware Requirements

- Any Linux laptop or PC
- x86_64 CPU
- 4–8 GB RAM recommended
- Microphone
- Speakers or headphones

Designed to run without GPU acceleration.

---

## Project Status

⚠️ Early-stage / experimental

- Core pipeline defined
- APIs and interfaces may evolve
- Focus is on correctness and architecture, not polish

---

## Philosophy

- **Local-first** — you own the system
- **Explicit over magical** — transparent processing
- **Minimal dependencies** — fewer moving parts
- **Composable** — easy to extend with new intents

---

## License

Open-source. License to be defined.

## Audience

- Backend engineers
- Applied AI / NLP engineers
- Linux users
- Developers interested in real-time audio systems

If you want a consumer assistant, buy one.
If you want to understand and control the pipeline, build Hey Computer.
